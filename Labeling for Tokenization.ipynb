      "investments in mlps involve risks different from those of investing in common stock including risks related to limited control and limited rights to vote on matters affecting the mlp, risks related to potential conflicts of interest between an mlp and the mlp’s general partner, cash flow risks, dilution risks (which could occur if the mlp raises capital and then invests it in projects whose return fails to exceed the cost of capital raised) and risks related to the general partner’s limited call right.\n",
      "mlps are generally considered interest-rate sensitive investments.\n",
      "during periods of interest rate volatility, these investments may not provide attractive returns.\n",
      "depending on the state of interest rates in general, the use of mlps could enhance or harm the overall performance of the fund.\n",

      "a change in current tax law or in the underlying business mix of a given mlp could result in an mlp being treated as a corporation for u.s. federal income tax purposes, which would result in such mlp being required to pay u.s. federal income tax on its taxable income.\n",

      "because a relatively high percentage of a non-diversified fund’s assets may be invested in the securities of a limited number of companies that could be in the same or related economic sectors, the fund’s portfolio may be more susceptible to any single economic, technological or regulatory occurrence than the portfolio of a diversified fund.\n",

      "as the seller (writer) of a covered call option, the fund assumes the risk of a decline in the market price of the underlying 3 security below the purchase price of the underlying security less the premium received, and gives up the opportunity for gain on the underlying security above the exercise option price.\n",
      "\n",
      "· preferred stock risk .\n",
      "the prices of preferred stock typically respond to interest rate changes, decreasing in value if interest rates rise and increasing in value if interest rates fall.\n",

      "these may include decreases in real estate values, overbuilding, rising operating costs, interest rates and property taxes.\n",
      "in addition, some real estate related investments are not fully diversified and are subject to the risks associated with financing a limited number of projects.\n",

      "the fund may be subject to a greater risk of rising interest rates due to the current period of historically low rates.\n",
      "the longer the duration of the fund's debt securities, the more sensitive it will be to interest rate changes.\n",
      "(as a general rule, a 1% rise in interest rates means a 1% fall in value for every year of duration.)\n",
      "a low interest rate environment may prevent the fund from providing a positive yield or paying fund expenses out of current income.\n",

      "the fund's performance could be hurt if an issuer of a debt security suffers an adverse change in financial condition that results in the issuer not making timely payments of interest or principal, a security downgrade or an inability to meet a financial obligation.\n",
      "for securities that rely on third-party guarantors to support their credit quality, the same risks may apply if the financial condition of the guarantor deteriorates or the guarantor ceases to insure securities.\n",
      "because guarantors may insure many types of securities, including subprime mortgage bonds and other high-risk bonds, their financial condition could deteriorate as a result of events that have little or no connection to securities owned by the fund.\n",

      "when interest rates rise, issuers of lower interest debt obligations may pay off the debts later than expected (extension risk), thus keeping the fund's assets tied up in lower interest debt obligations.\n",

      "in such cases, the value determined for an investment could be different from the value realized upon such investment's sale.\n",

      "to the extent that the fund focuses its investments in particular industries, asset classes or sectors of the economy, any market price movements, regulatory or technological changes, or economic conditions affecting companies in those industries, asset classes or sectors may have a significant impact on the fund's performance.\n",
      "the fund may have significant exposure to obligations of banks and other financial institutions and industrial issuers and market price movements, regulatory or technological changes, or economic conditions affecting such issuers could significantly impact the fund's performance.\n",

      "• it may be difficult or impossible to liquidate a security position at a time and price acceptable to the fund owing to the potentially less frequent trading of stocks of smaller market capitalization.\n",
